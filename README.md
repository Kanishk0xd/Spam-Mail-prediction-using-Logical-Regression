# Spam Mail Prediction using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a *Spam Mail Prediction* model using *Logistic Regression. The goal is to classify emails as **Spam or Not Spam (Ham)* based on their textual content. The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from *Kaggle*.

## 📂 Dataset
- *Source*: [Kaggle - Spam Mail Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- *Description*: The dataset contains labeled email messages categorized as either spam or ham.
- *Features*:
  - Email text content
  - Label (Spam/Ham)

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- *Python*
- *Scikit-learn* (for Logistic Regression and model evaluation)
- *Pandas* (for data manipulation)
- *NumPy* (for numerical computations)
- *NLTK* (for text preprocessing)
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn* (for data visualization)

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-mail-prediction.git
   cd spam-mail-prediction
   
2. Install required dependencies:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project folder.
4. Run the script to train the model:
   bash
   python spam_classifier.py
   

## 🏗 Model Training & Evaluation
1. *Preprocessing Steps*:
   - Tokenization & Stopword Removal
   - Text Vectorization using TF-IDF
2. *Training*:
   - Logistic Regression is trained on the dataset.
3. *Evaluation Metrics*:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, Recall, and F1-score

## 📊 Results
- The model achieved an accuracy of *X%* on the test set.
- Confusion matrix and classification report were used for further evaluation.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning techniques like LSTMs.
- Use more advanced NLP models like BERT.
- Improve feature engineering for better accuracy.
